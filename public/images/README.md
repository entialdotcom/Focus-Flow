# Background Images for Focus Flow

Place your mode background images in this directory with the following filenames:

- `focus.png` - Background image for Focus mode card
- `relax.png` - Background image for Relax mode card
- `sleep.png` - Background image for Sleep mode card
- `meditate.png` - Background image for Meditate mode card

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: PNG (or JPG/JPEG)
- **Recommended Size**: 800x600px or larger
- **Aspect Ratio**: 4:3 or 16:9 works well
- **Style**: Images will be displayed at 20% opacity by default, increasing to 30% on hover
- Images will be layered under the gradient overlay for visual consistency

## How Images Are Used

Each image serves as a subtle background texture that:
1. Appears at 20% opacity behind the gradient
2. Increases to 30% opacity on hover for visual feedback
3. Is covered by an 80% opacity gradient to maintain readability
4. Uses `background-size: cover` and `background-position: center` for optimal display

The images add visual interest while keeping the text and UI elements clearly visible.
